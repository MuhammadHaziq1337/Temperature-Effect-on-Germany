# Germany's GDP and Death Rate in Relation to Temperature

## Overview

This project, explores the relationship between Germany's economic and social metrics with temperature fluctuations. The analysis is divided into two main sections:

### 1. Germanyâ€™s GDP in Relation to Temperature

#### Questions Addressed:
- How does Germany's GDP change with temperature fluctuations?
- Is there a discernible pattern over the years?

#### Key Insights:
- There appears to be a correlation between Germany's GDP and temperature, with warmer years typically showing positive economic trends and colder years showing a decline.

#### Rationale for Design Choices:
- A dual-axis line chart is utilized to display both GDP and average temperature, facilitating a clear, side-by-side comparison.

#### Stock Market & Seasonal Analysis:

##### Questions Addressed:
- How do stock market values shift with the changing seasons?
- Is there a relationship between stock market performance and temperature?

##### Key Insights:
- The stock market tends to perform better during warmer months, particularly in summer and spring, indicating a possible correlation with temperature.

##### Rationale for Design Choices:
- Bar charts are used to delineate stock market values across different years and seasons. A scatter plot overlaid with a trend line illustrates the trajectory of stock market values.

### 2. Death Rate & Temperature Analysis

#### Questions Addressed:
- How does the death rate fluctuate with temperature variations in Germany?
- Are there seasonal patterns to be identified?

#### Key Insights:
- A notable trend shows that winter months, which bring colder temperatures, also experience higher death rates in Germany.

#### Rationale for Design Choices:
- Scatter plots are used to elucidate the correlation between death rates and temperatures. The color and size of each data point represent the season and the annual percentage change, respectively.
