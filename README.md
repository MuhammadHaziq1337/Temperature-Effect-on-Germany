# Temperature-Effect-on-Germany

## Overview
This project, explores the relationship between Germany's economic and social metrics with temperature fluctuations. The analysis is divided into two main sections:

### Germany’s GDP in Relation to Temperature

### Questions Addressed:

How does Germany's GDP change with temperature fluctuations?
Is there a discernible pattern over the years?
Key Insights:

There appears to be a correlation between Germany's GDP and temperature, with warmer years typically showing positive economic trends and colder years showing a decline.
Rationale for Design Choices:

A dual-axis line chart is utilized to display both GDP and average temperature, facilitating a clear, side-by-side comparison.
Stock Market & Seasonal Analysis:

Questions Addressed:
How do stock market values shift with the changing seasons?
Is there a relationship between stock market performance and temperature?
Key Insights:
The stock market tends to perform better during warmer months, particularly in summer and spring, indicating a possible correlation with temperature.
Rationale for Design Choices:
Bar charts are used to delineate stock market values across different years and seasons. A scatter plot overlaid with a trend line illustrates the trajectory of stock market values.

### Death Rate & Temperature Analysis

### Questions Addressed:
How does the death rate fluctuate with temperature variations in Germany?
Are there seasonal patterns to be identified?
Key Insights:
A notable trend shows that winter months, which bring colder temperatures, also experience higher death rates in Germany.
Rationale for Design Choices:
Scatter plots are used to elucidate the correlation between death rates and temperatures. The color and size of each data point represent the season and the annual percentage change, respectively.
